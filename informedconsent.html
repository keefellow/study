      <p>You are invited to participate in a research study on how
        practice of mindful affirmations via a mobile app may have an
        effect on your perceptions during this COVID-19 pandemic. This
        study is conducted by<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Assistant Professor
          Kee Ying Hwa, National Institute of Education, Singapore at
          the Nanyang Technological University</b>.<br>
        <br>
        This study will be conducted<span>&nbsp;</span><b>over 8 days</b>,
        which will involve<span>&nbsp;</span><b>using the designated app
          to record the frequency of practice of mindful affirmations</b>,
        as well as responding to questionnaires twice.<br>
        <br>
        Before beginning the study, we ask that you first think of<span>&nbsp;</span><b>a
          phrase that you believe is personally meaningful</b>,
        something which can be used as an verbal affirmation that can
        help you feel more positive in this COVID-19 situation. For
        example, this affirmation may be short phrases like<span>&nbsp;</span><b>“Think
          positive”</b>,<span>&nbsp;</span><b>“This too shall pass”</b>,<span>&nbsp;</span><b>“We
          will overcome this”</b>, or any phrase, mantra or invocations
        that you want to focus on. This affirmation should be a phrase
        you are willing to repeated aloud or silently at least between
        20 to 500 times per day, over these next 7 days. You can also
        use a simple phrase like<span>&nbsp;</span><b>“I notice my
          breathe”</b><span>&nbsp;</span>as an affirmation, which may
        help to facilitate your practice of mindful breathing when you
        say it repeatedly.<br>
        <br>
        Whatever phrase you decide on as your affirmation, while you
        repeat the affirmation verbally (silently or aloud), you are
        asked to<span>&nbsp;</span><b>mindfully tap on the counting
          button on the app</b>. As you coordinate your verbalisation
        with your hand action during this task, such practice may bring
        about a sense of mindful focus and attention, which in turn may
        have some effects on your well-being. To help you stay
        motivated, we also provide a chart within the app to help you
        keep track of your progress over the seven days.<span>&nbsp;</span><b>You
          will be given a minimum daily target to meet, which can be
          between 20 to 500 counts</b>.<br>
        In addition to the data we collect from your mindful affirmation
        practice, you will also be asked to complete<span>&nbsp;</span><b>two
          online surveys on Day 1 and Day 8</b>. In particular, we
        kindly request that you remember to complete the survey on Day
        8, regardless of your practice frequency. This will help improve
        the validity of this study.<br>
        <br>
        A target of<span>&nbsp;</span><b>1000</b><span>&nbsp;</span>participants
        are targeted for this study.<br>
        <br>

        Although your participation in this research may not benefit you
        personally, it will help us understand how such affirmative
        practices can improve psychological well-being during this
        period of COVID-19 pandemic. There will be no compensation
