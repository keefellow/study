<p class="p1">&lt;h1&gt; Mindful Affirmation Practice Mobile App Study (COVID-19)</p>
<p class="p1">NTU-IRB Ref no. IRB-2020-04-027 &lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="+20"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="+20"&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; You are invited to participate in a research study on how</p>
<p class="p1">practice of mindful affirmations via a mobile app may have an</p>
<p class="p1">effect on your perceptions during this COVID-19 pandemic. This study</p>
<p class="p1">is conducted by &lt;b&gt;Assistant Professor Kee Ying Hwa, National</p>
<p class="p1">Institute of Education, Singapore at the Nanyang Technological</p>
<p class="p1">University&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">This study will be conducted &lt;b&gt;over 8 days&lt;/b&gt;, which will</p>
<p class="p1">involve &lt;b&gt;using the designated app to record the frequency of</p>
<p class="p1">practice of mindful affirmations&lt;/b&gt;, as well as &lt;/b&gt; responding to</p>
<p class="p1">questionnaires twice&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">Before beginning the study, we ask that you first think of &lt;b&gt;a</p>
<p class="p1">phrase that you believe is personally meaningful&lt;/b&gt;, something which</p>
<p class="p1">can be used as an verbal affirmation that can help you feel more</p>
<p class="p1">positive in this COVID-19 situation. For example, this</p>
<p class="p1">affirmation may be short phrases like &lt;b&gt;“Think positive”&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;“This too shall</p>
<p class="p1">pass”&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;“We will overcome this”&lt;/b&gt;, or any phrase,</p>
<p class="p1">mantra or invocations that you want to focus on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">This affirmation should be a phrase you are willing to repeated aloud or silently at least between 20 to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>500 times per day, over these next 7 days.</p>
<p class="p1">You can also use a simple phrase like &lt;b&gt;“I notice my breathe”&lt;/b&gt; as an</p>
<p class="p1">affirmation, which may help to facilitate your practice of</p>
<p class="p1">mindful breathing when you say it repeatedly. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">Whatever phrase you decide on as your affirmation, while you repeat the</p>
<p class="p1">affirmation verbally (silently or aloud), you are asked to &lt;b&gt;mindfully</p>
<p class="p1">tap on the counting button on the app&lt;/b&gt;. As you coordinate</p>
<p class="p1">your verbalisation with your hand action during this task, such</p>
<p class="p1">practice may bring about a sense of mindful focus and</p>
<p class="p1">attention, which in turn may have some effects on your well-being. To</p>
<p class="p1">help you stay motivated, we also provide a chart within the app</p>
<p class="p1">to help you keep track of your progress over the seven days. &lt;b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">You will be given a minimum daily target to meet, which can be between</p>
<p class="p1">20 to 500 counts&lt;/b&gt;.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">In addition to the data we collect from your mindful affirmation</p>
<p class="p1">practice, you will also be asked to complete &lt;b&gt;two online</p>
<p class="p1">surveys on Day 1 and Day 8&lt;/b&gt;. In particular, we kindly</p>
<p class="p1">request that you remember to complete the survey on Day 8,</p>
<p class="p1">regardless of your practice frequency. This will help improve</p>
<p class="p1">the validity of this study. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">A target of &lt;b&gt;1000&lt;/b&gt; participants are targeted for this study. &lt;br&gt;</p>

<p class="p1">Your participation in this study is completely voluntary, and</p>

<p class="p1">wish to answer. If you do not wish to complete the study, simply</p>
<p class="p1">delete the mobile application. &lt;br&gt;</p>

<p class="p1">Although your participation in this research may not benefit you</p>
<p class="p1">personally, it will help us understand how such affirmative</p>
<p class="p1">practices can improve psychological well-being during this</p>
<p class="p1">period of COVID-19 pandemic. There will be no compensation</p>
