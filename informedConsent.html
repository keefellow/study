Mindful Affirmation Practice Mobile App Study (COVID-19)  
NTU-IRB ref no. <IRB-XXXX-XX-XXX>
<br>
<br> 

 
<br>
You are invited to participate in a research study on how practice of mindful affirmations via a mobile app may have an effect on perceptions during this COVID-19 pandemic. This study is conducted by Assistant Professor Kee Ying Hwa, National Institute of Education, Singapore from Nanyang Technological University.
<br>
This study will be conducted over 8 days, which will involve using the designated app to record the frequency of practice of mindful affirmations, as well as responding to questionnaires twice.
<br>
Before the study, you will first be asked to decide on a phrase that you believe is personally meaningful, which can be used as an affirmation that can help you feel more positive in this COVID-19 situation. For example, this affirmation may be “Think positive”, “This too shall pass”, “We will overcome this”, or any phrase, mantra or invocations that you want to focus on. You can also use a simple phrase like “I notice my breathe” as an affirmation, which can help to facilitate your practice of mindful breathing.
<br>
<br>
Whatever phrase you select as an affirmation, as you repeat the affirmation verbally (silently or aloud), you are asked to mindfully tap on the counting button on the app. As you coordinate your verbalisation with your hand action during this task, such practice is purported to help you develop mindful focus and attention, which may have some effects on your well-being.  To help you stay motivated, we also provide a chart within the app to help you keep track of your progress over the seven days.  You will be given a daily target to meet, which can be between 20 to 500 counts.  
<br>
In addition to the data we collect from your mindful affirmation practice, you will also be asked to complete two online surveys on Day 1 and Day 8. In particular, we kindly request that you remember to complete the survey on Day 8, regardless of your practice frequency.  This will help improve the validity of this study.
<br>
A total of 1000 participants are targeted for this study.
<br>
Your participation in this study is completely voluntary, and you have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any penalty. You may skip also any questions you do not wish to answer. If you do not wish to complete the study, simply delete the mobile application.
<br>
Your participation in this research will be kept confidential. Your responses will be anonymous and IP addresses will not be collected to guarantee complete anonymity. Possible outlets of dissemination may be journals related to public health, mindfulness, and mhealth.
<br>
Kindly note that anonymised and non-identified data collected from this study may be published in open data depository under the University’s data sharing guidelines.
<br>
Although your participation in this research may not benefit you personally, it will help us understand how such affirmative practices can improve psychological well-being during this period of COVID-19 pandemic. There will be no compensation provided.
<br>
There are no risks to individuals participating in this survey beyond those that exist in daily life.
